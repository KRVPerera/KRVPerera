### Hi there, I am Rukshan Perera (KRVPerera) ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently dancing on Ballerina compiler front end
- :zap: I'm working on personal project which are purely written in C++
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning about pixel art and 3D hard surface modelling
- I cannot work on small improvements on skills to achieve a skill but I can optimize for passion and have burst of focus on tasks to get things done.
  This is how I did this [HD Movie Club](https://hdmovieclub.netlify.app/). Pomodoro technique does not work for me.
- I am like Tinker Bell; always creating tools to speed up my work and of team members. Of course I share the tools I create for my self. This is how I ended up creating this [Balty](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KRVPerera.balty)
- My Passions
  - 3D Design (Blender)
  - C++ (mostly writing efficient code - Optimization)
  - QT - of course to help create end products in C++, I like C# + Visual Studio combination to create UIs but does not like windows as a development environment.
  - Learning Piano (electric organ)
  - Learning Java Script (I hated java script for no reason at all, but lately I figured it allowed me to create a finished product easily and it is easy to reach people. I also understand that learning a framework like react does not add good skills to you unless I understand what is happenign underneath.)
  - Isekai, Fantasy, Science Fiction
    - Reading audio books and reading fantasy books. I love to listen to Isekai genre in Audible.
    - I also like to watch anime related to this generes
    - Video Games (Elden Ring, StarDew Valley, Skyrim, Witcher, Driving Simulators, etc..)
  - Speed Reading (still practicing)
  - Fast Typing Speed (still practicing Highest : 78.71 WPM and Average : 57 WPM)
